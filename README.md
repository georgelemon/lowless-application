![Loopless Micro App Framework](.github/loopless-cover.png)

## Loopless
**A minimal PHP framework for developing front-end web applications.** Loopless main scope is to be an API addicted and stay wired to your whatever backend apps (one or more), but it can be also used as a static & standalone app (see WikiPeep project).

Out of the box, Loopless comes with a MVC structure (without a database setup), a simple Router with dependency injection support, a Configuration Array in Laravel style and that's it. It is highly recommended for creating front-end apps, small to medium websites. Fully OOP, with Composer support - all you need is creativity. 🤪

### Roadmap

### Projects made w/ Loopless
If you made something cool with Loopless, let me know by creating an issue and I will put it here!

#### [WikiPeep](https://georgelemon.com/projects/wikipeep/) - An Open Source Wiki for Busy Devs. <kbd>WIP</kbd>
Powered by Loopless, Symfony Console, Markdown and JSON. Using WikiPeep you can create modern wiki documentation without dealing with databases. [Github Repository](https://github.com/georgelemon/wikipeep) <code>GPLv3</code>

#### [Kampánia](https://georgelemon.com/projects/kampania) - Your Mailchimp Campaign builder Assistant. <kbd>WIP</kbd>
Originally made for a private luxury villa rentals company. The main task was to give to non technical people the chance to run Mailchimp campaigns without touching the code.

**Kampánia is not a drag and drop builder**,  instead, requires a front-end developer / designer to create  premade templates based on <code>MJML</code> & <code>Placeholders</code>, and make them available in Kampánia Stacks so marketing teams can do their job without worrying they screw up with something 😂 [Github Repository](https://github.com/georgelemon/kampania) <code>AGPL</code>
